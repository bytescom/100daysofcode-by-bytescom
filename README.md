# **100DaysOfCode-Challenge-by-bytescom**

The **100DaysOfCode Challenge** is an exciting journey of coding for 100 days, where I am building projects ranging from **basic to advanced**. Starting with **vanilla JavaScript**, gradually progressing to mastering **React** with popular frameworks, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for backend development, and eventually diving into **full-stack applications**.  

This challenge also includes projects leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to solve real-life problems.

Each phase of the challenge focuses on specific skills and projects, ensuring a structured learning path. Every day, I am working on a new project, learning something valuable, and building my portfolio step by step.  

Whether I am a beginner or an experienced developer, this challenge is designed to push my limits, enhance my skills, and help me create impactful projects. Let’s code, learn, and grow together!
